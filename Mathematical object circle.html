A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. Equivalently, it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number. A circle with \( r=0\) (a single point) is a degenerate case.

<H4>Circumference</H4>
<p align="justify">
The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is  \( \pi\), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the circumference C is related to the radius \(r\) and diameter \(d\) by:

\[ C=2\pi r=\pi d.\]

<H4>Area</H4>
<p>
As proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to π multiplied by the radius squared:

\[ \mathrm {Area} =\pi r^{2}.\]
Equivalently, denoting diameter by \(d\),
\[\mathrm {Area} ={\frac {\pi d^{2}}{4}}\approx 0{.}7854d^{2},\]
that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d).

<H3>Equations</H3>
<p align="justify">


In an x–y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that

\[ (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}.\]
This equation, known as the equation of the circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |x − a| and |y − b|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to

\[ x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}. \]
